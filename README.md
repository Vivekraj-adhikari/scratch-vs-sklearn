# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

This repository contains **machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python** to build a strong understanding of their mathematical foundations and internal working.  
Each model is implemented using **NumPy**, applied to real-world datasets, and compared with standard library implementations where applicable.

The goal of this repository is **learning by building**, not just using high-level APIs.

## 📌 Motivation

Machine learning libraries abstract away most of the underlying math.  
This repository is created to:

- Understand how ML algorithms work internally
- Implement models without relying on ML libraries
- Learn optimization techniques such as gradient descent
- Compare custom implementations with `scikit-learn`
- Build a strong foundation for advanced ML and DL concepts

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
4. Navigate to the model directory you want to explore  
5. Open the Jupyter notebook and run all cells  
6. Read the model-specific README for detailed explanations
